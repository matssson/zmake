# zmake: A Convenient and Customizable Build System for C++ (without Headers)
A build system for C/C++ inspired by Rust's cargo,
meant to be as convenient and simple as possible.

By default zmake uses unity builds to speed up compilation time.
This can be turned off by typing the flag "-nounity".

If you use the custom file extension .zpp (or .z) you also get things
to improve the quality of life when coding in C++, like the removal of headers,
and automatically adding things into one file for fast compilation (unity builds),
with forward declarations so you don't have to worry about the order of functions or includes.
All of this is customizable and it works seamlessly with other C/C++ code and headers.

You can also change the default config by changing defaultconfig.cfg in /global.

# How to Build
Make a new project with "zmake new project_name".
Then just put the code in the /src folder, if you have any libraries put them in
/include and /lib, or specify them along with other build flags in zmake.cfg,
or put them globally in zmake/global/include and zmake/global/lib.

Build and run the dev build with "zmake run".
Build the release build with "zmake build".
Build the debug build with "zmake debug".
Open the most recently compiled build with "zmake open".
Remove target files with "zmake clean".

You can also add any "-gccflags" at the end of your command
to compile with them, or the following built in commands:
"-dev/-debug/-release" (change build profile),
"-nocmd" (hide compiler command),
"-notime" (hide compilation time),
"-nobuild" (only running),
"-nounity" (turn off unity builds),
"-norun" (only building),
"-run" (run after building),
or "-gcc/-clang/-clang++" to change compiler.

# Features
No headers, so you don't have to worry about function prototypes
and which order your functions are in.

To include another file, just type:
```cpp
#include "otherfile.zpp"
```

# Installing zmake
### Windows
I strongly recommend using clang-cl for Windows development, since it has full
functionality with all the system headers (unlike gcc) and it has better warnings,
and faster performing code than MSVC. To get clang-cl, you first need to install
MSVC by downloading Visual Studio, and then install clang and adding it to PATH
by downloading the latest version of LLVM.

On Windows, download the code to C:\\zmake, and add C:\\zmake to the PATH, by going to:
```
"Edit the system environment variables" ("Redigera systemets miljÃ¶variabler")
-> "Environment Variables" -> "Path" -> "Edit" -> "New"
```
And putting in "C:\\zmake", then build it with Clang (or use the precompiled binary):
```
clang-cl -std:c++17 -EHsc -Ofast -march=native src/zmake.cpp -o zmake
```
Now you can just call it from cmd, git bash, or any other terminal of choice!

### Linux
On Linux, download the code to /$HOME/zmake and add the directory to PATH,
by opening the file ".bashrc" in $HOME and adding the line:
```
export PATH=/$HOME/zmake:$PATH
```
This is then run every time you start the computer. To update without restarting, run:
```
source .bashrc
```
Or if you don't wanna add a PATH variable you can create the following alias:
```
alias zmake="/$HOME/zmake/zmake"
```
Then build it with gcc:
```
g++ -std=c++17 -fexceptions -Ofast -march=native src/zmake.cpp -o zmake
```
And you're good to go!

### macOS (and BSDs)
This has not been tested, but download the code to /usr/local/opt/zmake,
and add the directory to your system's PATH. Then compile it with clang (or gcc):
```
clang++ -std=c++17 -fexceptions -Ofast -march=native src/zmake.cpp -o zmake
```
And it should work.

# Other
To make .z and .zpp files automatically detected as C++ code in Atom
for syntax highlighting, Press Ctrl+Shift+P and go to Application: Open Your Config
and under the core extension add:
```
core:
  customFileTypes:
    'source.cpp': [
      'z'
      'zpp'
    ]
```

### Notes
zmake flags work with hyphens or slashes (-dev = /dev).

If you change the compiler when running zmake, the resulting file will be named "\_custom",
and the flags (but not the optimization) from your initial build profile will be ignored.

If you don't want to create a new git project, you can use zmake gl projname (gl = gitless).

You can also compile using simply "zmake file.z" or "zmake file.z -flag name".

If you add -o or not doesn't matter unless you specify -c -S or -E.

#### Compiler flags:

-pedantic   -> -Wpedantic (just use Wpedantic always)

-save-temps -> -save-temps=obj (not yet implemented)

#### Clang-cl specific improvements (also applies for MSVC, but support for that compiler is limited overall):
-fexceptions -> -EHsc

-O0          -> -Od     // Clang-cl recognizes -Ofast as -O2 by default, but not -O0.
